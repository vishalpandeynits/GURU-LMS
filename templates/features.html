<b class="mx-4 p-4 col-md-8 col-sm-12 mx-auto">Note: The person who will create a classroom will be treated as an admin. 
    After that other people can join this classroom. Then Admin can then create subjects and assign it to a teacher.
    Only admin and teacher are allowed to post contents in this subject, unless they give permission to any other
    student to upload resources(This user will not be allowed to add assignments or announcements). Also admins can 
    make admin to other members or remove from the position of admins. Admins will also have permission to remove
    members from classroom. There are lot of other features besides it. Happy exploring to you.
